Vocabulary
Git
Is a distributed Version Control System (DVCS). Version control systems offer tools that help you track the history of a set of files. With GIT you can save the state of your file at any point, and later save updated states. States can be compared to creating a backup copy, a name used for saving a state is creating a commit.

Commit
A Commit is an updated version of the file you are working on that is saved and can be  be referenced later. Along with saving the update, it requires a detailed description of the improvements and changes made to the file.

Repository
A repository is a collection of commits, or the place where the history of the file is kept.

GitHub
Is a central repository available to anyone interested in pulling a version or commit.

Pull
Is the request of the file from the repository.

Push
is the upload of the new version to the repository.

Branch
Is a parallel version of a repository. It still exists within the original repository, but does not change the original or master branch.

Merge
Takes the changes from a branch, and adds them to another. 

Merge Conflict
Occurs when two developers are updating the same code. To avoid conflicts developers work on separate isolated branches and merge branches ensuring there are no conflicts.

Fetch
Allows the user to request information (new comments, files…) from the remote repository into a local repository. Without forcing the user to merge branches, thus preserving the work done locally.

Remote
The version of something that is hosted on a server. It can be connected to local clones to sync the changes.

Clone 
Is a copy of the repository stored in a computer instead of a web-site’s server. With a clone you can edit the files on a preferred editor and use GIT to keep track of your changes offline. You can push your changes to the local remote version so changes can be synced when your online.
